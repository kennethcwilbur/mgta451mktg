    "This is probably the thing we see wrong with Y Combinator apps most frequently, is that people have not thought about the market first, and what people want first."

::: notes
- It's probably OK that youtube (an advertising service) sold ads to meta (a client)
- But is it OK to target users on the basis of missing targeting data like age?
- And is it OK to say your safeguards worked under these conditions?
- And why cancel the project if the safeguards worked?
- And why aren't you enforcing your own standards prior to this incident?
- And why is the right repsonse more training for sales staff, rather than actually enforcing your standards?
- So many questions...

## Customer Insights

- Market research

          - Interviews Focus groups Surveys Experiments Observations

- Conjoint analysis
          
          - Stated-preference data trading off attributes, price
          - Quantifies how potential attributes affect demand and profits
          - Can predict competitor response and proactive strategy
          - Multiple limitations, but powerful and popular

- Net Promoter Score, Reviews

          - NPS: "How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?"
          - Simplistic but powerful indicator of customer satisfaction
          - Helps to identify most & least important aspects of value proposition, pain points, misunderstandings, segmentation, opportunities to improve
          - Reviews are super important, but also : truncated distribution, non-representative, fake-able

“Our core business is connected with the customers’ needs and we will not be able to satisfy them if we don’t have a deep sense of empathy.”

## Sales

- Sales is widespread in B2B industries

- Salespeople offer 

          - customer needs discovery & product customization
          - customer risk mitigation & service
          - relationships & trust; can generate new leads
          - education, negotiation, even customer agency 

- Marketing dept usually generates leads, <br>then constrains & supports sales

- How do marketing and sales usually interact?

          - What role do analytics play in sales?


## Bottom line

Advertising & sales cannot fix a broken value proposition, misunderstanding of consumer needs, unsustainable competitive position, absence of customer trust

          - We have to start with the customer first, then monitor and test our understanding as things evolve

Marketing strategy == sustainable value proposition vs. competitors based on the market's heterogeneous customer needs, perceptions and behaviors

Advertising & sales can help to implement a good strategy

          - Without a strategy, we're shooting in the dark, likely wasting money
          - This is why marketing has to be more than just ads & sales

## Takeaways

- Customers keep the lights on

      - Customers might buy if they trust the product will meet their needs 

- Good marketing understands and profitably meets customer needs to maximize long-run profits

      - Ads and sales require a compelling strategy to be profitable

- Long-term focus aligns customer and company interests, sidesteps most ethical problems

      - We have to genuinely serve our target customers
