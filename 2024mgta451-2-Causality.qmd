## Toy economics of advertising {.smaller}

- Suppose we pay $20 to buy 1,000 digital ad OTS. Suppose 3 people click, 1 person buys.

- Ad profit > 0 if transaction margin > $20

          - But we bought ads for 999 people who didn't buy

- Or, ad profit > 0 if CLV > $20 

          - Long-term mentality justifies increased ad budget  

- Or, ad profit > 0 if CLV > $20 *and* if the customer would not have purchased otherwise

          - This is "incrementality"
          - But how would we know if they would have purchased otherwise?

- Ad effects are often subtle, but ad profit can still be robust

          - Ad profit depends on ad cost, conversions, margin, objective formulation

- Suppose 10 outcomes, 1000 predictors, N=100,000 obs

          - Outcomes might include visits, sales, reviews, ...
          - Predictors might include customer attributes, session attributes, ...

- Suppose everything is noise, no true relationships

          - The distribution of the 10,000 correlation coefficients would be Normal, tightly centered around zero

          - A 2-sided test of {corr == 0} would reject at 95% if |r|>.0062

- We should expect 500 false positives 

          - What is a 'false positive' exactly?

- In general, what can we learn from a significant correlation?

## Classic misleading correlations {.smaller}

- "Lucky socks" and sports wins

          - Post hoc fallacy [1] (precedence indicates causality AKA superstition)

- Commuters carrying umbrellas and rain

          - Forward-looking behavior

- Kids receiving tutoring and grades

          - Reverse causality / selection bias
          
- Ice cream sales and drowning deaths

          - Confounding variables

- Correlations are measurable & usually predictive, but hard to interpret causally

          - Correlation-based beliefs are hard to disprove and therefore sticky
          - Correlations that reinforce logical theories are especially sticky
          - And let's acknowledge: Correlation-based beliefs are often correct!
          - Note, examples:explanations are not 1:1

::: notes
This AB test triggered a "revenue too high" alert at Microsoft Bing in 2012
The treatment improved horizontal space usage and enlarged a selling argument in search ads
Bing had a robust experimentation platform and culture. They run over 10k tests/year
The RTH alert indicates a possible code error that might be defrauding advertisers
In this case it was just a really big treatment effect, biggest ever.
This change increased revenue 12% without significant harm to user experience metrics. Over $100 million per year
We can explain it ex post (HARKing) but nobody expected such a big effect

## Causal Inference

-   Suppose we have a binary "treatment" or "policy" variable $T_i$ that we can "assign" to person $i$

        - Examples: Advertise, Serve a design, Recommend
        - "Treatment" terminology came from medical literature

-   Suppose person $i$ could have a binary potential "response" variable $Y_i(T_i)$

        - Examples: Visit site, Click product, Add to Cart, Purchase, Rate, Review
        - Looks like the marketing funnel model we saw previously

- Important: $Y_i$ may depend fully, partially, or not at all on $T_i$, and the dependence may be different for different people



## Why care?

- We want to maximize profits $\pi_i(Y_i(T_i), T_i)$ 

- Suppose $Y_i=1$ contributes to revenue; then $\frac{d\pi_i}{dY_i} >0$ 

- Suppose $T_i=1$ is costly; then $\frac{d\pi_i}{dT_i}=\frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial Y_i}\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial T_i}+\frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial T_i}$

- We have to know $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial T_i}$ to optimize $T_i$ assignments

        - Called the "treatment effect" (TE) 

- Profits may decrease if we misallocate $T_i$

## **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

-   We can only observe **either** $Y_i(T_i=1)$ **or** $Y_i(T_i=0)$, but not both, for each person $i$

- This is a missing-data problem that we cannot resolve. We only have one reality

          - The case we don't observe is called the "counterfactual"

[Rubin Causal Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model){target="_blank"}
:::

## So what can we do? {.smaller}

1. Experiment. Randomize $T_i$ and estimate $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial T_i}$ as avg $Y_i(T_i=1)-Y_i(T_i=0)$

        - Called the "Average Treatment Effect"
        - Creates new data; costs time, money, attention; deceptively difficult to design and then act on

2. Use assumptions & data to estimate a "quasi-experimental" average treatment effect using archival data

        - Requires expertise, time, attention; difficult to validate; not always possible

3. Use correlations: Assume past treatments were assigned randomly, use past data to estimate $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial T_i}$

        - Easier than 1 or 2; but T is only randomly assigned when we run an experiment, so what exactly are we doing here?

4. Fuhgeddaboutit, go with the vibes, do what we feel

## How much does causality matter?

          - How hard should we work?

- Organizational returns or costs of getting it right?

- Data thickness: How likely can we get a good estimate?

- How does empirical approach fit with organizational analytics culture? Will we act on what we learn? 

- Individual: promotion, bonus, reputation, career; Will credit be stolen or blame be shared? 

- Accountability: Will ex-post attributions verify findings? Will results threaten or complement rival teams/execs?

          - Analytics culture starts at the top
        
## Ad/sales example: Experiment {.scrollable .smaller}

1. Randomly assign ads to customer groups on a platform; measure sales in each group

        - Often called "incrementality" in ad/sales context

        - Pros: AB testing is easy to understand, easy to implement, easy to validate
        
        - Cons: Can we trust the platform's "black box"? Will we get the data and all available insights? Could platform knowledge affect future ad costs?
 
2. Randomly assign messages within a campaign 
      
3. Randomly choose times, places, segments or combinations; compare treated times to controls
        
4. Randomize over budgets and bids

5. Randomly choose platforms, publishers, behavioral targets, etc., to compare RoAS across options

          RoAS = Return on Ad Spend. Usually, RoAS = Sales / AdSpend. Sometimes, =(Sales-AdSpend)/AdSpend

## Experimental necessary conditions{.smaller}

1. Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

        - Treatments do not vary across units within a treatment group
        - One unit's treatment does not change other units' potential outcomes, i.e. treatments in one group do not affect outcomes in another group
        - Often violated when treated units interact on a platform
        
2. Observability

        - Non-attrition, i.e. unit outcomes remain observable
        
3. Compliance

        - Treatments assigned are treatments received
        
4. Statistical Independence

        - Random assignment of treatments to units

:::

## 2. Ad/sales example: Experiment {.scrollable}

Key issues for any experimental design: 
        
        - Always run A:A test first. Validate the infrastructure before trusting a result
        
        - Can we agree on the opportunity cost of the experiment? "Priors"
        
        - How will we act on the (uncertain) findings? Have to decide before we design
        
        - Example: Suppose we estimate RoAS at 0.5 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.45, 0.55]. Or, suppose we estimate RoAS at 0.5, but we have a 95% confidence interval of [-2.1, 3.1]. How will we act?
        

## Quasi-experiments Vocab {.smaller }

**Model**: Mathematical relationship between variables that simplifies reality, eg y=xb+e

**Identification strategy**: Set of assumptions that isolate a causal effect $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial T_i}$ from other factors that may influence $Y_i$

          - A system to compare apples with apples, not apples with oranges

We say we "identify" the causal effect if we have an identification strategy that reliably distinguishes $\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial T_i}$ from possibly correlated unobserved factors that also influence $Y_i$

If you estimate a model without an identification strategy, you should interpret the results as correlational

          - This is widely, widely misunderstood

You can have an identification strategy without a model, e.g. <br>avg  $Y_i(T_i=1)-Y_i(T_i=0)$

Usually you want both. Models help with quantifying uncertainty and estimating treatment effects by controlling for relevant observables


## 2. Ad/sales: Quasi-experiments

Goal: Find a "natural experiment" in which $T_i$ is "as if" randomly assigned, to identify $\frac{\partial T_i}{\partial Y_i}$

Possibilities:

          - Firm starts, stops or pulses advertising without changing other variables, especially when staggered across times or geos
          - Competitor starts, stops or pulses advertising
          - Change in ad prices, availability or targeting for exogenous reasons that don't affect Y (e.g., election or outage)
          - Discontinuous ad copy/campaign changes without changing other variables

:::

## Ad/sales: Quasi-experiments (2){.scrollable .smaller}

Or, construct a "quasi-control group"

- Customers or markets with similar demand trends where the firm never advertised

- Competitors or complementors with similar demand trends that don't advertise

Helpful techniques: Difference in differences, Synthetic control, Regression discontinuity, Matching, Instrumental variables

In each case, we try to predict our missing counterfactual data, then estimate the causal effect as observed outcomes minus predicted outcomes


## 3. Ad/sales example: Correlational

Just get historical data on $Y_i$ and $T_i$ and run a regression

           Most people use OLS, but Google's CausalImpact R package is also popular

The implicit assumption is either that there are no unobservables that influence both $Y_i$ and $T_i$ ; or that we are OK with a correlation

          "Better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong"
          But are we the guy in the truck bed?
          

## Strongest case for corr(ad,sales)

Corr(ad,sales) should contain signal

          - If ads cause sales, then corr(ad,sales)>0 (probably) (we assume)

Some products/channels just don't sell without ads

          - E.g., Direct response TV ads with 1800 #s response lines
          - Career professionals tell me those #s get 0 calls until a TV ad
          - Then they get 1-5 calls per 1k viewers, lasting up to ~30 minutes
          - Then calls drop back to 0 ; so here we actually know the counterfactual
          - We can calculate exact profits if we know call profit and ad cost
          - What are some digital analogues to this?

However, this argument gets pushed too far

          - For example, when search advertisers disregard organic link clicks when calculating search ad click profits
          - Notice the converse: corr(ad,sales)>0 does not imply a causal effect of ads on sales

## Problem 1 with corr(ad,sales)

Suppose you advertise in places where you expect a big response

            E.g. surfboards in coastal cities, not landlocked cities

Corr(ad,sales) will be big, partly because of differences in addressable market sizes

            More ads in san diego, more surfboard sales in san diego

            Corr(ad,sales) would overestimate the causal effect of ads on sales, and likely lead you to spend too much on ads in san diego

Many, many firms basically do this


## Problem 2 with corr(ad,sales)

1. Advertisers wisely select ad campaign placements, targeting and intensity to maximize impact

          - Sometimes, we use ML algos that max corr(ad,sales)

2. Post-campaign, we get data on ad spending and outcomes to estimate RoAS

3. If we assume that past $T_i$ is random, that's the same as saying that we performed step 1 incompetently 

          - Typically, T_i is only random when we run an experiment
          - This type of selection/treatment problem is common in marketing
          - What if ad vendor tells us to assume T_i is random?

## Problem 3 with corr(ad,sales)

- How do most advertisers set ad budgets?

1. Percentage of sales method, e.g. 3% or 6%

2. Competitive parity

3. ...others...

Do you see the problem here?

![](images/circularity.png){fig-align="right" width=3in}




## Problem 4 with corr(ad,sales)

- Leaves marketers powerless vs ~~big~~ colossal ad platforms

- Google and Meta withhold data and obfuscate algorithms

          - How many ad placements are incremental?
          - How many ad placements target likely converters?
          - How can advertisers react to adversarial ad pricing?
          - How can advertisers evaluate brand safety, targeting, context?

- Have ad platforms ever left ad budget unspent?          

          - Would you, if you were them?
          - If not, why not? What does that imply about incrementality?

- To balance platform power, know your ad profits, vote with your feet

::: notes
- This was written by a federal judge, an impartial observer who heard mountains of evidence on both sides
- Note that he quotes internal google documents extensively
- Was it legal that google tried to hide price increases from advertisers? Arguably yes, google is supposed to maximize google profits, though you could argue the practice was unethical or too short-term-focused. The case was about whether google monopolized the search engine market by excluding competitors, not whether google was supposed to be transparent about why auction prices increased. This point was simply a fact in the case that the government used to counter google's claim that it could not control ad auction prices, and therefore did not have monopolist pricing power.

## Why are some teams OK with corr(ad,sales)?

1. Some worry that if ads go to zero -> sales go to zero

        - For small firms or new products, this may be good logic
        - Downside of lost sales may exceed downside of foregone profits
        - However, claim may imply a customer satisfaction problem. Happy customers usually share their experiences with others. If you really believe this, try a referral program
        - Plus, we can run experiments without setting ads to zero, e.g. weight tests

2. Some firms assume that correlations indicate direction of causal results

        - The guy in the truck bed is pushing forwards right?
        - Biased estimates might lead to unbiased decisions
        - But direction is only part of the picture; what about effect size?


## Why are some teams OK with corr(ad,sales)?

3. CFO and CMO negotiate ad budget

        - CFO asks for proof that ads work
        - CMO asks ad agencies, platforms & marketing team for proof
        - CMO sends proof to CFO ; We all carry on

4. Few rigorous analytics cultures or ex-post checks

        - In some cultures, ex-post checks can get personal 


5.Estimating causal effects of ads can be pretty difficult

        - Many firms lack expertise, patience, execution skill
        - Ad/sales tests may be statistically inconclusive, especially if small
        - Tests are often designed without subsequent actions in mind, then fail to inform future decisions

## Why are some teams OK with corr(ad,sales)?

6. Platforms often provide correlational ad/sales estimates

        - Which is larger, correlational or experimental ad effect estimates?
        - Which one would most client marketers prefer?
        - Platform estimates are typically "black box" without neutral auditors
        - Sometimes platforms respond to marketing executive demand for good numbers
        - "Nobody ever got fired for buying [famous platform brand here]"

7. Historically, agencies usually estimated RoAS

        - Agency compensation usually relies on spending, not incremental sales
        - Principal/agent problems are common
        - "Advertising attribution" is all about maximizing credit to ads
        - These days, more marketers have in-house agencies, and split work
        - Should adFX team report to CFO or CMO?

## 

![](images/gtrends_adexp.png){fig-align="center" width=9in}


          - I believe we're a few years into a generational shift
          - However, corr(ad,sales) is not going away
          - Union(correlations, experiments) should exceed either alone




## Marketing Mix Model {.smaller}

- The "marketing mix" consists of quantifiable marketing efforts, such as product line, length and features; price and price promotions; advertising, PR, social media and other communication efforts; retail distribution intensity and quality; etc.

- A "marketing mix model" quantifies the relationship between marketing mix variables and outcomes

          - Idea goes back to the 1950s
          - E.g., suppose we increase price & ads at the same time
          - Or, suppose ads increased demand, and then inventory-based systems raised prices

- A "media mix model" quantifies numerous advertising efforts & relates them to outcomes

          - For example, suppose the brand bought ads from 000s of publishers
          - Confusingly, both abbreviated MMM (or mMM) and often feature similar structures

- MMM goal is to quantify past marketing mix effects, to better inform future efforts


## MMM elements {.smaller}

Typically, MMM uses market/time data

          - Outcome: usually sales. Could include more funnel metrics (visits, leads, ...)
          - Predictors: Marketing mix factors under our control, plus competitor variables, seasonality, macroeconomic factors, + any other demand shifters

Model structure is usually some type of panel regression, vector autoregression, bayesian model, or machine learning model

          - Often includes lags, nonlinear ad effects, interactions between variables
          - Regressions typically estimate marginal effects, not average effects
          - Nonlinearities built into the model, such as Inc or Dec returns to ad spend, can drive key results

MMM often used to retrospectively evaluate advertising media and copy, advertising interactions, and inform future ad budgets

          - MMM coefficient estimation requires sufficient variation in marketing actions


## MMM Considerations {.smaller}

- MMM results are correlational without experiments or quasi-experimental identification strategy

- Data availability, accuracy, granularity and refresh rate are all critical

- MMM requires sufficient variation in predictors, else it cannot estimate coefficients

- "Model uncertainty" :  Results can be strongly sensitive to modeling choices

- MMM is gaining traction as digital privacy rules limit user data: E.g. [Google's Meridian](https://developers.google.com/meridian){target="_blank"} or [Meta's Robyn](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/){target="_blank"}

- For much more, see this [MSI White Paper](https://github.com/kennethcwilbur/website/raw/master/MSI-MMM-Blue-Ribbon-Panel-Report-Updated.pdf){target="_blank"} or the [MMM Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling){target="_blank"}
          
          
## Other Popular Ad/Sales Approaches

          Remember, model <> identification strategy

- Lift Tests

- Multi-touch attribution (MTA)

          - Seeks to allocate "credit" for sales across advertising touchpoints
          - Related: First-touch attribution, last-touch attribution

- Cookie-based approaches vs. Google's Privacy Sandbox 

- Ghost ads 

- Other platform-provided experimentation tools

## Ken's take {.smaller}

- Adopting incremental methods is a resume headline & interesting challenge

          - Team may have a narrow view of experiments or how to act on them
          - Understanding that view is the first step toward addressing it
          
- Correlational + Incremental > Either alone

          - What incrementality might be valuable? What's our hardest challenge?
          - What quasi-experimental measurement opportunities exist?
          - Can we estimate the relationship between incremental and correlational KPIs?
          
- Going-dark design

          - Turn off ads in (truly) random 10% of places/times; nominally free
          - How does going-dark result compare to correlational model's predicted sales?
          - Can we improve the model & motivate more informative experiments?
          
- If structural incentives misalign, consider a new role

          - It's hard to reform a culture unless you're in the right position 
          - Life is short, do something meaningful          

## Takeaways

- Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference: <br>We can't observe all data needed to optimize actions. <br>This is a missing-data problem, not a modeling problem.

        - Experiments, Quasi-experiments, Correlations, Ignore

- Experiments are the gold standard, but are costly and difficult to design, implement and act on

- Ad effects are subtle but that does not imply unprofitable
