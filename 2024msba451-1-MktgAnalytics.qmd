    "This is probably the thing we see wrong with Y Combinator apps most frequently, is that people have not thought about the market first, and what people want first."

## Traditional Marketing Frameworks: Mainly Vibes

- Situation analysis: 3/4/5 C's

          - Customer Competitor Company / Context / Collaborators

- Strategic decisions: STP

          - Segmentation Targeting Positioning

- Tactical decisions: 4/.../10 P's, AKA the "Marketing Mix"

          - Product Price Place Promotion

- Brand equity

          - Brand awareness Brand associations Perceived quality Brand loyalty

## Modern Marketing Frameworks: <br>Mostly Empirical

          - Attention Interest Desire Conviction Action Satisfaction
          - Visit Consider Purchase Retention Advocacy
          
- Customer lifetime value

          - Acquisition Retention Monetization Referral Divestiture

          - Regression analysis to estimate marketing mix effects on sales

## Customer Insights

- Market research

          - Interviews Focus groups Surveys Experiments Observations

- Conjoint analysis
          
          - Stated-preference data trading off attributes, price
          - Quantifies how potential attributes affect demand and profits
          - Can predict competitor response and proactive strategy
          - Multiple limitations, but powerful and popular

- Net Promoter Score, Reviews

          - NPS: "How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?"
          - Simplistic but powerful indicator of customer satisfaction
          - Helps to identify most & least important aspects of value proposition, pain points, misunderstandings, segmentation, opportunities to improve
          - Reviews are super important, but also : truncated distribution, non-representative, fake-able

“Our core business is connected with the customers’ needs and we will not be able to satisfy them if we won’t have a deep sense of empathy.”

## Sales

- Sales is widespread in B2B industries

- Salespeople offer customer needs discovery, relationships & trust, product customization, risk mitigation & service, education, negotiation, even customer agency 

- Marketing dept usually generates leads, then constrains & supports sales

- How do marketing and sales usually interact?

- What role do analytics play in sales?


## 

No amount of advertising or sales can fix a broken value proposition, misunderstanding of consumer needs, unsustainable competitive position, absence of customer trust

That's why start with the customer first, then monitor and test our understanding as things evolve


## Takeaways

- Customers keep the lights on

      - Customers only buy if they understand how the product will reliably meet their needs 

- Marketing is about understanding and profitably meeting customer needs to maximize long-run profits

      - Ads and sales require a compelling value proposition to be profitable

- Long-term focus aligns customer and company interests, sidesteps most ethical problems

      - We have to genuinely serve our target customers
