## Learning Objectives

1. Practice reading analytics papers

3. Exposure to cutting-edge analytics at leading companies

4. Practice critiquing, questioning, understanding analytics frameworks 

5. Get to know each other better

## WTF is a "paper"

- For centuries scientists communicated using "papers"

          - The basic format has stubbornly survived digitization, with improvements

- Scientists write papers to (i) communicate results, (ii) get feedback, (iii) get credit, and/or (iv) improve the world in some small way

- In analytics, sometimes we write papers to get clients or users

## What's in a paper?

1. Problem to solve or questions to answer

          - "Problem to solve" : Engineering
          - "Questions to answer" : Science

2. Brief review of earlier relevant works

          - Can help contextualize the proposed solution

3. The proposed solution

4. How we tested or implemented the proposed solution

5. Results or discussion of learnings

6. Untested opinions 

          - Further questions/problems that our new knowledge has enabled us to ask
          - If we're intellectually honest, some caveats and limitations 

## Why do I need to read "papers"?

- Analytics frontier is constantly moving

          - Prof. retools every 5 years or so
          
- Valuable new tools often appear with accompanying papers to explain them

          - Paper is usually the clearest resource if you know how to read 
          - Paper is written by person with most expertise

- Paper writing correlates with high skill and commitment

- You'll read many papers in MSBA 

- Reading papers is a skill that will improve with experience

          - Let's get started

## How to do this project well

- Pick a MAA that interests you, based on company and/or topic

- Sincere effort to understand your MAA

          - It's OK if you don't understand all finer details
          - Take the authors' word at face value and try to get the big picture
          - I expect this project to stretch you
          - Discomfort signals potential growth, stay calm

- Sincere effort to explain to classmates

- Intellectual honesty & humility, but don't be intimidated

- Some original content that was directly inspired by the MAA



## Next Steps

1. Let's finalize project parameters

2. Assign, form or finalize teams & MAAs

3. Quick read of the paper

4. Think about presentation structure and team roles, let's discuss

5. Careful read of the paper, presentation development 

6. Practice & record video

7. Don't spend time editing video, just submit your first decent take

## Should I email MAA authors?

- You are free to do so

          - Most papers include author contact info
          - Most authors care about making their work accessible
          - Most authors are seldom contacted about their papers

- Will author reply?

          - It probably depends on the message length and preparedness
          - Most authors will respond if question is well motivated and informed
          - Some authors will never respond
          - Some authors will respond exactly once, implying that you won't get a chance to follow up
          - You can add author on LinkedIn to predict if they will respond
