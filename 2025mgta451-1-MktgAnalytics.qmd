## Customer Value: Challenges

- Customers often don't know CV (not their job)

- CV often confounded with attitudes, beliefs, <br>limited information

- CV is always subjective, often malleable & socially influenced

- CV measures are incomplete and biased (e.g., reviews)

- Easy to misinterpret available CV measures

- CV measurement is not always prioritized

::: aside
You can measure and manage customer value, with discipline and focus

Marketers need to be the company's customer experts<br> Often, marketers need to advocate for customer interests internally

The only respectable marketing objective: Long-term profits

![](images/callsanta.png){fig-align="center" width="6in"}

::: aside
Long-term orientation aligns marketer's interest with customer's<br> Keeping a customer is far cheaper than attracting a new customer <br> Customer retention is necessary for customer acquisition to be profitable
:::

::: notes
Short-termism is a major driver of unethical or misleading marketing tactics

Absence of competition is another major driver

::: notes
-   It's probably OK that youtube (an advertising service) sold ads to meta (a client)
-   But is it OK to target users on the basis of missing targeting data like age?
-   And is it OK to say your safeguards worked under these conditions?
-   And why cancel the project if the safeguards worked?
-   And why aren't you enforcing your own standards prior to this incident?
-   And why is the right repsonse more training for sales staff, rather than actually enforcing your standards?
-   So many questions...

## Traditional Marketing Frameworks: Mainly Vibes, but still Important

-   Situation analysis: 3/4/5 C's

    ```         
        - Customer, Competitor, Company / Context / Collaborators
    ```

-   Strategic decisions: STP

    ```         
        - Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning
    ```

-   Tactical decisions: 4/.../10 P's, AKA the "Marketing Mix"

    ```         
        - Product, Price, Place, Promotion
    ```

-   Brand equity

    ```         
        - Brand awareness, Brand associations, Perceived quality, Brand loyalty
    ```

## Modern Marketing Frameworks: <br>Mostly Empirical

-   Purchase funnel aka AIDA aka Customer journey

    ```         
        - Attention, Interest, Desire, Conviction, Action, Satisfaction
        - Visit, Consider, Purchase, Retention, Advocacy
        
    ```

-   Customer lifetime value

    ```         
        - Acquisition, Retention, Loyalty, Development, Referrals
    ```

-   Marketing mix modeling, AKA Media mix modeling

    ```         
        - Regression analysis to estimate marketing mix effects on sales
        - Owned media, Earned Media, Paid Media
    ```

-   Heterogeneity, Targeting & Personalization

    ```         
        - Experience, needs, perceptions, wtp, purchases, recommendations, reviews
    ```

::: notes
MrBeast's onboarding PDF for new employees leaked The first topic is employee quality and effort The second topic is a simple marketing funnel: CTR, AVD, AVP. CTR is the first thing they focus on, they won't greenlight a video without a compelling title & thumbnail that (a) they think will go viral, and (b) is true to video content (else it harms AVD) AVD is what they prioritize second, because are in the business of attracting viewer attention in order to max their ad revenue payout These 3 metrics are how they evaluate video content success ex post

## Personalization Profit Impact

Alibaba personalizes product recommendations based on demographics, past clicks, past purchases, etc.

AB test: Randomly turned off personalization for 555,800 visitors

      - Goal was to predict restrictive privacy policy effects

Click-throughs fell 75%, visits fell 33%, gross spending fell 81%

      - Helps explain why many businesses oppose data-privacy rules

## Customer Insights

-   Market research: Creates customer data 

    ```         
        - Interviews, Focus, groups, Surveys, Experiments, Observations
    ```

-   Conjoint analysis: Empirical decisionmaking framework

    ```         
        - Generate stated-preference data trading off attributes, price
        - Quantifies how potential attributes affect demand and profits
        - Can predict competitor response and proactive strategy
        - Multiple limitations, but powerful and popular
    ```

-   Net Promoter Score, Reviews

    ```         
        - NPS: "How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?"
        - Simplistic but powerful indicator of customer satisfaction
        - Helps to identify most & least important aspects of value proposition, pain points, misunderstandings, segmentation, opportunities to improve
        - Reviews are super important, but also : truncated distribution, non-representative, fake-able
    ```

“Our core business is connected with the customers’ needs and we will not be able to satisfy them if we don’t have a deep sense of empathy.”

## Sales

-   Sales is the primary marketing channel in B2B 

```
B2B marketing teams are smaller than B2C marketing teams
```

-   Why do great salespeople earn so much money?

    ```         
        - profit impact is directly observable
        - educate customers, negotiate, even act as customer agents
        - enable customer needs discovery & product customization 
        - enable customer risk mitigation & service
        - build relationships & trust, help generate and develop warm leads
    ```

-   Marketing dept manages brand, sources and prioritizes leads, then supports & constrains sales

-   How do marketing and sales usually interact?

    ```         
        - What role do analytics play in sales?
    ```

## Marketing truisms

Advertising & sales cannot fix a broken value proposition, misunderstanding of consumer needs, unsustainable competitive position, or absence of customer trust

```         
Start with customer value first, then monitor and test as market evolves
```

Marketing strategy == sustainable value proposition vs. competitors based on the market's heterogeneous customer needs, perceptions and behaviors

Advertising & sales can implement a good strategy

```         
      - Without strategy, we're shooting in the dark, likely wasting money
      - This is why marketing has to be more than just ads & sales
```

## Takeaways

-   Customers keep the lights on

    ```         
    - The only 3 ways to generate revenue are to attract, retain and develop customers
    ```

-   Great marketing creates customer value in order to maximize long-run profits

    ```         
    - Ads and sales require a compelling strategy to avoid reducing profits
    ```

-   Long-term focus aligns most customer and company interests, avoids ethical problems

## Exercise 1: Customer Interviews {.scrollable .smaller}

You're going to conduct and write up your first customer interviews. 

1.  Choose any customer need that most Rady grad students experience. Pick a customer need that interests you, other than caffeinated beverages. \[5 min\]

2.  Write a 4-question interview script to learn customer need, solution, experience and value. Customize the questions for your category. Write down what you expect to learn from each question. Submit on canvas (Ex 1A, 1 per team, 100 words max). \[25 min\]

*Sample: 1. Tell me about the last time you bought a **caffeinated beverage**. Why did you buy it? (Motivation, context) 2. Describe the purchase experience. (Place, consideration set, price) 3. Please describe the consumption experience. (Taste, effectiveness, etc <-- CV) 4. Would you recommend it to a friend? Why or why not? (Satisfaction)*

3. Each team member interviews a classmate in another group, and be interviewed by same classmate. \[30 min\]

4.  Collate interviews, write up what you learned, and what surprised you. Submit on canvas (Ex 1B, 1 per team, 100 words max). \[30 min\]

LLM use encouraged. Time limits are strict. Debrief after. 

Tips: Open-ended questions only. Listen actively. Ask "why." Don't "lead the witness."
