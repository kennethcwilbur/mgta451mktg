## WTF is a "paper"

- For centuries scientists communicated using "papers"

          - The basic format has stubbornly survived digitization, with improvements
          - But they can be hard to read, and they are definitely hard to write

- Scientists write papers to (i) communicate & archive results, (ii) get feedback, (iii) get credit, and/or (iv) improve the world in some small way

- In analytics, some write papers to attract clients/users

## What's in a paper?

1. Problem to solve and/or question(s) to answer

          - "Problem to solve" : Engineering
          - "Question(s) to answer" : Science

2. Brief review of earlier relevant works

          - To contextualize the proposed solution // avoid reinventing wheels

3. The "Contribution"

          - Usually, new methods, new knowledge, or both

4. How we implemented the contribution & what we learned

5. Discussion (read: opinions)

          - Contribution importance, implications, new questions/problems the contribution enables us to examine
          - If we're intellectually honest, caveats and limitations 

## Why do I need to read "papers"?

- Analytics frontier is constantly moving

          - Prof. retools every 5 years or so 
          
- Valuable new tools often appear with papers to explain them

          - Paper is usually the clearest resource, if you know how to read papers
          - Paper is written by person with most expertise: Learn from the best

- Paper writing correlates with high skill and commitment

- Reading papers is a skill that improves with experience

- You'll read many papers in MSBA : Let's get started


## How to do this project well

- Pick an interesting MAA, based on company, topic, solution

- Sincere effort to understand your MAA

          - It's OK if you don't understand 100% of finer details
          - Do make an effort, but don't get too bogged down
          - Take the authors' word at face value and try to get the big picture
          - I expect this project to stretch you, discomfort can signal growth

- Sincere effort to explain to classmates

          - MAA Video questions will be asked on quiz

- Intellectual honesty & humility, but don't be intimidated

- Some original content that was directly inspired by the MAA

          - Any team that does great, I'll publish the video & retire the MAA

## Next Steps

1. Let's finalize Team MAA assignments & project parameters

2. Read MAA carefully & develop OC

3. Prepare slides & record video

4. Upload .mp4 uploaded to instructure/canvas

Does presentation quality matter?

## Should I contact MAA author?

- You are free to do so

          - Most papers author contact info, some indicate "corresponding author"
          - Most authors care about making their work accessible
          - Most authors are seldom contacted about their papers

- Will author reply?

          - Probably depends on the inquiry quality
          - Some authors will never respond; some authors will respond exactly once, which implies no chance to follow up
          - You can add author on LinkedIn to predict if they will respond
 

## FAQ & Resources {.smaller}

- Why a video?
      
          - Constrains length, reduces nerves, enables asynchronous viewing & archiving

- Project parameters: See [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqZCZRSac796cR4mhOeQra1ARa-ChVBJPyIL_xP_u4c/edit){target="_blank"}

          - People/team, video duration, Q&A duration?

- Deadline? Sep 6 7:30am 

- What if I don't understand key elements of the paper?

          - Code, LLMs, internet forums, classmates, Piazza, me/TA, or make do with partial understanding
          
- Does my video have to be perfect?

          - No way, that's unrealistic, every video will have limitations
